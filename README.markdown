The Moo class DPHYS::MacAddress represents MAC addresses.  It makes sure that a
MAC address is valid.  The constructor accepts a number of representations.
There are a number of methods to convert the MAC address to a string that
follows certain conventions.

For details see the manual, i.e., `perldoc DPHYS::MacAddress`.
